# Starter Skeleton Theme for Shopify

This _is not_ a framework. This will not try to give you fancy ways to do cool stuff. This is designed to get a bespoke theme up and running quickly.

This _is_ a set of build tools, a simple structure and some basic scss.

## Tools

- Shopify Theme Kit: [http://themekit.cat/install/](http://themekit.cat/install/)
- Inside SCSS: [https://github.com/stewartknapman/inside](https://github.com/stewartknapman/inside)

### Shopify Theme Kit
We recommend using Shopify's Theme Kit rather than the Theme Gem. This is what Shopify's own developers use, and has the ability to use multiple environments (i.e. development, staging, production, etc.).
